Node.js RESTful API with Docker
This is a simple Node.js RESTful API that's designed to run inside a Docker container. It serves as an example of how to containerize a Node.js application.

Project Structure
server.js: The main server file where the API endpoints are defined.
package.json: Node.js project descriptor file. Contains metadata and dependencies of the project.
Dockerfile: Used to containerize the application.
Prerequisites
Node.js and npm
Docker
Getting Started
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_github_username/node-restful-api-docker.git
cd node-restful-api-docker
Run locally without Docker:

Install dependencies:

Copy code
npm install
Start the server:

Copy code
node server.js
You should see the server running message. Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Using Docker:

Build the Docker image:

Copy code
docker build -t node-restful-api-docker .
Run the Docker container:

arduino
Copy code
docker run -p 3000:3000 node-restful-api-docker
Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

CI/CD with GitHub Actions
This repository uses GitHub Actions to implement a simple CI/CD pipeline:

On each push to the main branch, the pipeline checks out the code, sets up Node.js, installs dependencies, (optionally) runs tests, builds a Docker image, and pushes it to DockerHub.

DockerHub credentials are securely stored in the GitHub repository's secrets.
